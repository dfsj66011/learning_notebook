# TinyML and Efficient Deep Learning

## 6.S965 • Fall 2022 • MIT

Have you found it difficult to deploy neural networks on mobile devices and IoT devices? Have you ever found it too slow to train neural networks? This course is a deep dive into efficient machine learning techniques that enable powerful deep learning applications on resource-constrained devices. Topics cover efficient inference techniques, including model compression, pruning, quantization, neural architecture search, and distillation; and efficient training techniques, including distributed training, gradient compression and on-device transfer learning; followed by application-specific model optimization techniques for video, point cloud, GAN and NLP; it will cover futuristic research on quantum machine learning. Students will get hands-on experience implementing deep learning applications on microcontrollers and mobile phones with an open-ended design project related to mobile AI.
